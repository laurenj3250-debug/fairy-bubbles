# November 2025 Goals & Habits Setup

## Summary

Your November goals and weekly habits have been successfully configured in the Fairy Bubbles (GoalConnect) app! Once you copy the Neon credentials into a local `.env` file (see `DATABASE_SETUP.md`) or run the new `./scripts/bootstrap-neon.sh` helper, the app will use the hosted database so your progress persists across restarts and devices.

If you just want to explore locally first, you can skip Neon entirelyâ€”run `npm run dev`, sign in with **demo / demo1234**, and everything will work using the built-in in-memory store (data resets on restart). Prefer to bypass the login screen altogether while experimenting? Set `AUTH_DISABLED=true` in `.env` and restart the dev server.

# optional: ./scripts/bootstrap-neon.sh   # runs the env/migration/seed flow for you

```

## Technical Details

### Changes Made

1. **Automatic storage selection** (`GoalConnect/server/storage.ts`)
   - Uses Neon (`DbStorage`) when `DATABASE_URL` is set
   - Falls back to the seeded in-memory store for quick demos without any setup

2. **Customized seed data** (`GoalConnect/server/storage.ts:105-178`)
   - Replaced demo habits with your 10 weekly habits
   - Replaced demo goals with your 15 monthly goals
   - Kept all other features (virtual pet, costumes, points system)

3. **Added simple username/password auth** (`GoalConnect/server/auth.ts`)
   - Express session + Passport local strategy protect all `/api` routes (unless you set `AUTH_DISABLED=true` for local dev)
   - Credentials come from `APP_USERNAME` / `APP_PASSWORD` with safe defaults

### Data Persistence Note

âœ… **With the Neon credentials in `.env`, your data now lives in the hosted database.** Run through the four setup steps in `DATABASE_SETUP.md` to apply migrations and seed everything once.

Want a temporary offline demo? Just leave `DATABASE_URL` empty. The app will automatically use the seeded in-memory store (progress resets whenever the server restarts).
