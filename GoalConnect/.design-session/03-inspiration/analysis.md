## Key Visual Patterns Observed

### Hero Numbers
- **BIG, BOLD primary metrics** - "6.27K", "5.02 km", "45:25"
- Numbers are the centerpiece, not buried in tables
- Often gradient text or glowing effects

- Success states: Green/emerald
- **Glassmorphism** - frosted glass cards over dark bg

### Card Patterns
- Rounded corners (12-20px radius)
- Subtle gradients or glass effect
- Icon + metric + label pattern
- Small colored accent bars/indicators

### Charts & Visualizations
- **Wave/area charts** with gradient fills
- **Circular progress rings** (Apple Watch style)
- **Line charts** with glowing line effects
- Calendar heatmaps for consistency

### Achievement Badges

- Stacked/overlapping badge displays
- "80 Day Streak" prominently displayed
- Gold/bronze/silver tier indicators
- 3D/illustrated badge styles popular
- "Fitness God" title with badge = celebration

### Running/Activity Specific
- **Route maps** as background or hero element
