# F1: Design Brief - Strava/Kilter Integration Pages

## The Vision
Create dedicated pages for Strava and Kilter Board integrations that match the **Summit Journal energy** - epic, achievement-focused, makes you feel like a champion.

## User Motivations (Primary)
1. **Progress & Mastery** - Want to see improvement over time (harder grades, faster/farther runs)
2. **Consistency & Streaks** - Care about showing up regularly; the habit matters

## What to Avoid
- **Bad UI** - No boring data dumps or generic dashboards
- **Doesn't show awesomeness** - Must celebrate achievements, not just display numbers

## Design Reference
The existing Summit Journal (`SummitJournal.tsx`) sets the bar:
- Hero section with mountain comparisons ("You've climbed 2.3x Everest!")
- Animated counters that count up
- Mountain-shaped grade pyramid visualization
- Personality analysis card (Volume Warrior, Flash Master, etc.)
- Personal records with colorful cards
- Glassmorphism cards with gradients
- Framer Motion animations throughout

## What We're Building
1. **Strava Page** - Dedicated page for running/cycling/swimming stats with the same epic energy
2. **Kilter Page** - Potentially evolve Summit Journal or create separate views
3. **Integration with Habits** - Show how external data auto-completes habits
4. **Rich Visualizations** - Charts, progress indicators, comparisons that inspire

## Key Questions for Research
- What metrics actually motivate vs. demotivate in fitness apps?
- How do top apps (Strava, Apple Fitness, Nike Run Club) visualize progress?
- What psychological principles drive sustained engagement?
- What should we show vs. hide to maintain motivation?

## Success Criteria
- User opens the page and feels proud
- Data tells a story, not just reports numbers
- Animations and visuals feel premium
- Connects meaningfully to habit tracking system
