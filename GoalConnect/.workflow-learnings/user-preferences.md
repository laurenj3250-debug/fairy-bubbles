# 👤 User Preferences & Style

## Communication Style

**Preference:** "I don't want to do shit"
- User wants automation, not manual steps
- Minimize user involvement in workflow
- Make things happen automatically
- Focus on "tell me what you want, I'll handle it"

**Lesson:** Always ask "can this be automated?" before suggesting manual steps.

## Workflow Preferences

**Quality over speed:**
- User expects things to work when deployed
- Wants to catch errors before they waste time
- Values automated checks and validation

**Learning mindset:**
- Asks "why isn't this already in the workflow?"
- Wants continuous improvement
- Expects the system to get smarter over time

**Communication:**
- Prefers concise explanations with options
- Wants to understand trade-offs
- Appreciates "here's what I recommend and why"

## Project Style

**Design:**
- Travel poster aesthetic
- Warm, bright colors (El Capitan Sunrise theme)
- Glassmorphism (backdrop blur, transparency)
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance

**Code preferences:**
- TypeScript strict mode
- Component-based architecture
- Theme variables over hardcoded colors
- Mobile-responsive by default

**Documentation:**
- Prefers TL;DR summaries
- Wants both quick reference and deep docs
- Values examples over theory

---

## Tools & Environment

**Stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Express + PostgreSQL backend
- Railway for deployment

**Workflow tools:**
- Husky for git hooks
- Playwright for testing
- Claude Code workflows for reviews
- Pre-commit/pre-push automation

## Anti-Patterns (Things to Avoid)

❌ Suggesting manual steps without automation
❌ Pushing code without local testing
❌ Hardcoded values instead of theme variables
❌ Accessibility issues (always check WCAG)
❌ Breaking mobile responsiveness
❌ TypeScript errors in new code

---

## Patterns to Follow

✅ Automate everything possible
✅ Test locally before pushing
✅ Use theme variables consistently
✅ Focus indicators on interactive elements
✅ Mobile-first responsive design
✅ Document learnings as we go
