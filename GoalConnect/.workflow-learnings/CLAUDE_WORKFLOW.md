# 🤖 Claude's Workflow Learning Protocol

## Before Starting Any Task

I will read these files in this order:

1. **`.workflow-learnings/user-preferences.md`**
   - Understand your communication style
   - Remember what you like/dislike
   - Apply your coding standards

2. **`.workflow-learnings/time-wasters.md`**
   - Check what's wasted time before
   - Avoid repeating past mistakes
   - Use proven solutions

3. **`.workflow-learnings/deployment-issues.md`**
   - Check for known deployment issues
   - Apply previous fixes
   - Prevent infrastructure problems

4. **`.workflow-learnings/optimization-wins.md`**
   - Use patterns that have worked
   - Apply successful approaches
   - Build on past successes

## While Working

**When I hit an issue:**
1. Check if we've seen it before in learnings
2. Apply the documented solution
3. If new, document it immediately
4. Suggest automation to prevent it

**When completing a task:**
1. Document any new learnings
2. Update relevant learning files
3. Suggest workflow improvements
4. Measure time saved

## After Each Session

**Review and update:**
- Time wasters encountered
- Optimizations discovered
- User preference insights
- Deployment lessons

**Suggest improvements:**
- New automations based on patterns
- Workflow enhancements
- Documentation updates

## The Learning Loop

```
Read Learnings → Apply to Work → Discover New Patterns →
Document Learnings → Improve Workflow → Read Better Learnings
```

## Current Active Learnings (Auto-Updated)

**Last updated:** 2025-11-14

**Key preferences:**
- Automate everything possible
- User doesn't want manual steps
- Test before pushing
- WCAG AA compliance required
- Mobile-responsive by default

**Active time savers:**
- Pre-push hooks (saves ~10 min/deployment)
- Component prop interfaces (saves ~30 min/bug)
- Theme variables (prevents design inconsistencies)

**Known issues to avoid:**
- Railway database connection issues (not code-related)
- 142 legacy TypeScript errors (work around for now)
- Build testing required before push

**Next workflow improvements:**
- [ ] Railway health check automation
- [ ] Automated visual regression testing
- [ ] Component interface generators

## How This Evolves

This file updates automatically as we work together. The more we build, the smarter the workflow becomes.

**Success metric:** Every week, workflow should get faster and catch more issues automatically.
