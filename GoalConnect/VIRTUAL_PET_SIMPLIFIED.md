## How the Points System Works

### Earning Points

#### Habit Completion
- **Base reward**: 10 coins per habit completed
- **Streak bonuses**:
  - 7+ day streak: +5 coins (15 total)
  - 14+ day streak: +10 coins (20 total)
  - 30+ day streak: +15 coins (25 total)

#### Goal Progress
- **5 coins** per 10% milestone reached
- Example: If you complete 10% of a goal, you get 5 coins

#### Your November Habits (All Award Points!)
1. Pimsleur (4 lessons/week) - 10+ coins each completion
2. Duolingo (5 sessions/week) - 10+ coins each completion
3. Gym (4 sessions/week) - 10+ coins each completion
4. Piano (3 sessions/week) - 10+ coins each completion
5. Daylight (3 times/week) - 10+ coins each completion
6. RemNote Study (1 chapter/week) - 10+ coins each completion
7. Create Flashcards (2-3 papers/week) - 10+ coins each completion

9. Outdoor Climbing (1 session/week) - 10+ coins each completion
10. Run (1 time/week) - 10+ coins each completion

## XP & Leveling System

- Level up every **100 XP**

### Evolution Stages

- **Level 5-9**: Sprout 🌿 (Growing!)
- **Level 10-14**: Sapling 🌳 (Getting strong!)

## The Bounce Animation 🎉

### When Your Pet Bounces
Your virtual pet will bounce whenever you:
- ✅ Complete a habit
- ✅ Make progress on a goal
- ✅ Earn points

This happens automatically when your points total changes!

### How It Works
- The pet component watches for changes in your total earned points
- When points increase → triggers a 0.6 second bounce animation
- Animation includes a cute hop effect (up to -20px translateY)
