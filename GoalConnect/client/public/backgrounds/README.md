# Mountain Background Images

Drop your beautiful mountain photos here! 📸

## How to Add Your Photos:

### 1. Save Your Images Here
Just drag and drop (or save) your mountain photos into this folder:
```
/client/public/backgrounds/
```

### 2. Naming Convention
Use descriptive names with no spaces:
- ✅ Good: `yosemite-sunset.jpg`, `denali-summit.jpg`, `patagonia-torres.jpg`
- ❌ Bad: `IMG_1234.jpg`, `my photo.jpg`, `background 1.jpg`

### 3. Image Requirements

**Recommended:**
- **Format**: JPG or PNG (JPG preferred for smaller file size)
- **Resolution**: At least 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape orientation)
- **File Size**: Under 2MB (compress at tinypng.com if needed)
- **Subject**: Mountain landscapes, peaks, ridges, alpine scenes

**What Makes a Good Background:**
- Clear, high-quality photo
- Not too busy (so text remains readable)
- Strong focal point (mountain, summit, ridge)
- Good lighting (sunrise/sunset are especially beautiful)
- Minimal people/equipment in frame

### 4. Tell Claude About It
Once you've added your images here, just tell me:
1. The filename (e.g., "yosemite-sunset.jpg")
2. Which mountain in your DB it should link to
3. The vibe/mood (e.g., "peaceful morning", "dramatic sunset", "stormy peak")

I'll automatically:
- Link it in the theme config
- Pick colors from your image to create a matching theme
- Set it up to unlock when you summit that mountain
- Test everything

## Current Background Slots:
