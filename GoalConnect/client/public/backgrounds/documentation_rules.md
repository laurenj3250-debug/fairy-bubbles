## Template Rules

### New Consult vs Recheck

**"New history" / "new consult"** = Full combined template with ALL of the following:
- Signalment
- Why are you here today
- CSVD
- PU/PD
- Painful/vocalizing
- Diet (dry/wet/raw)
- Allergies/food sensitivities
- Appetite
- Other pets
- Trauma
- Travel (down south/Canada/California)
- Medications
- Heartworm preventative
- Flea/Tick
- Vaccines up to date
- Other medical history
- "The owner reports" narrative
- Full neurologic exam
- Full physical exam
- Neurolocalization
- DDx
- Diagnostics
- Treatments
- Outcome with 3 options

**Recheck** = Shorter template with:
- "MRI on [DATE] revealed: [findings]"
- "Last Visit Changes/Summary"
- Abbreviated history (CSVD, PU/PD, Appetite, Medications ONLY)
- Full neuro exam
- Full PE
- Neurolocalization, DDx, Diagnostics, Treatments, Outcome

### Other Template Rules

- Do NOT include "Fasted" field in recheck/MRI drop off notes
- Never assume patient went to surgery unless explicitly stated. Medical management ≠ surgery.
- Neuro exam in recheck format has compact spacing (no blank lines between fields)
- Always update neuro exam findings from transcript - don't leave default normal values when abnormal findings are provided

## Email Rules

1. **ALWAYS sign as "The Neurology Team"** - never "Lauren," "Dr. Jacobson," "LJ," or any individual name
2. Keep concise - don't over-explain
3. Don't be overly enthusiastic or warm - professional tone
4. **Never say "falls outside of neurology"** or mention scope - just redirect to primary vet without explaining why
5. For difficult clients: be vague, non-committal, recommend recheck "with ourselves or your primary veterinarian"
6. Never say "I will forward to Dr. Glass" - Lauren is the doctor handling communications
7. For GI/non-neuro issues: recommend owner have pet seen/assessed by primary vet (can't just prescribe remotely without assessment)

2. Start with **SWO-** [Patient name]
3. End with "- LJ"
4. No headers, dates, or visit IDs
5. Single paragraph format

## Terminology Rules

- **ANNPE** is NOT a stroke - it's a concussive/contusive injury from acute disc extrusion
- **FCE** (fibrocartilaginous embolism) is the vascular event / "spinal stroke"
- Use correct neurolocalization terminology based on actual exam findings

- Include detailed pathophysiology explanation in discharge
- Include bedding/pressure sore care instructions

### Brain Tumor / Palliative Cases
- Home care focuses on comfort and monitoring

## General Rules

- Discharge summaries: keep concise, follow standard format
- Daily updates: carry forward relevant abnormal PE findings from previous notes
- For owners calling about results: instruct them to call us, never say "we will call you"
