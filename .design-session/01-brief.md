# Fairy Bubbles Homepage - Design Brief

## Problem Statement
The current homepage doesn't feel polished. It functions but lacks the craft and attention to detail that makes it feel like a finished product to be proud of.

## Target User
Personal use only (Lauren). No need to explain the climbing metaphor or onboard new users.

## Emotional Goal
**Satisfied & Proud** - When opening the app, should feel a sense of accomplishment seeing the progress built over time. The journey visualization and achievement milestones should be prominent.

## Visual Direction
- Keep the **climbing/mountaineering essence** - this is core to the app's identity
- **Comprehensive dashboard** - want to see everything at once (habits, goals, progress, weekly rhythm)
- **Polished and beautiful** - elevated craft, attention to detail, professional quality
- **Motivating** - should inspire action, not just display data
- **Visual richness** - not minimal/corporate, personality should shine through

## Key Requirements
1. All key information visible at a glance (no single-focus minimalism)
2. Progress and streaks prominently displayed
3. Today's habits accessible for quick logging
4. Goals/mountains showing summit progress
5. Weekly rhythm visible
6. The density should feel organized, not cluttered

## Design Challenge
How do we show "all of it" while making it feel **polished** rather than **busy**?

The answer lies in:
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Refined spacing and typography
- Subtle but intentional animation
- Cohesive color palette tied to the climbing theme
- Quality micro-interactions
- Attention to edge cases and empty states

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Opens and immediately feels "premium"
- [ ] Can see today's habits, overall progress, goals, and weekly rhythm without scrolling
- [ ] Maintains the climby/mountain personality
- [ ] Every pixel feels intentional
- [ ] Pride-inducing when showing to others
